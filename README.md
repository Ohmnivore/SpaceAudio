# This is a WIP

# Supported metadata formats
* mp3
* flac
* ogg vorbis (ogg)
* mp4 (m4a)

# TODO (immediate)
* Remove from library menu option
* New thread for loading songs, or else the window freezes

# TODO (eventually)
* Deal with incomplete metadata -> Unknown artist + unknown album defaults
* Force the directory tree to repaint on change
* Open arbitrary files
* Go ham on the UI like a QA tester
